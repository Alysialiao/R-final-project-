#### Dataset Description:
This dataset is trying to identified physico-chemicals and model wine quality base on the contributions of each component. the dataset has 12 variable and has 4898 inputs. Due to privacy and logistic issues, this dataset does not include the grape type, wine brand, and wine selling price. We have determine 

##### Dependent variable: quality
##### Independent variable: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol

##### Objective of the project: The dataset will be used to solve a regression problem. The variables we have in this dataset will be used to determine which properties make a wine ‘good’. 


```{r DataPre, include = FALSE}
library(readr)
df<-read_csv("winequality-red.csv")

```

##### The Summary of the model built is provided as below: 
```{r}
df<-tbl_df(read_csv("winequality-red.csv"))
```
```{r}
plot(glm_wine)
```

```{r}
plot(df)
```
#### Classification Tree
```{r}
df<-tbl_df(read_csv("winequality-red.csv")) %>%
  mutate(quality = as.factor(if_else(quality > 7,"High","Low" )))
```

```{r}
